Certified Red Hat OpenShift CNI Plug-in
We are pleased to introduce the availability of Cilium in the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog as well as the certification of Cilium as a Certified OpenShift CNI Plug-in. The Container Network Interface (CNI) badge is a specialization within Red Hat OpenShift certification available to networking products that integrate with OpenShift using a CNI plug-in. Users running OpenShift can feel confident that running Cilium will not negatively impact their Red Hat support experience.

The OpenShift certified version of Cilium is based on Red Hat Universal Base Images and passes the Operator certification requirements as well as the Kubernetes e2e tests.
