ogSummary: 'Linux 4.12-rc5 was recently released. No BPF changes where included, but a usual [GIT] Networking pull request was made afterwards. You can see the changes in 15th June.'

This is issue 07 of the regular newsletter around BPF written by Alexander Alemayhu. It summarizes ongoing development, presentations, videos and other information related to BPF and XDP. It is released roughly once a week.

Linux 4.12-rc5 was recently released. No BPF changes where included, but a usual `[GIT] Networking` pull request was made afterwards. You can see the changes in [15th June](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/776103/).

There were also several other patches to netdev and related lists. Most of them are fixes. The highlights are

- New program type `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_OPS` is in the works.
- Reporting XDP program ids via netlink.
- Improvements to the bpf tests.
- MIPS eBPF JIT got [applied](https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg440291.html).

## In case you missed it

### [eBPF and systems performance](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ebpf-and-systems-performance?cmp=tw-webops-confreg-article-vlca17_gregg_article_ac)

Short post explaining what eBPF is.

### [Build issues for samples/bpf/ after rebase or git pull (solved)](https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00208.html)

One of the not so obvious things when building bpf programs is the headers. If your project is reusing the kernel infrastructure you will need to keep your headers synchronized. This post tells you how.

### [[iovisor-dev] minutes: IO Visor TSC/Dev Meeting](https://lists.iovisor.org/pipermail/iovisor-dev/2017-June/000808.html)

From the meeting notes, looks like there will some interesting upcoming BPF talks in LA.

### [XDP Newbies...](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg162375.html)

> Which is a place where people can talk about getting up to speed with setting up an XDP build environment and writing XDP programs.

You can subscribe by sending a email to `majordomo@vger.kernel.org`, with a message body containing `subscribe xdp-newbies`. No subject is needed, but you can of course add one if you like.
